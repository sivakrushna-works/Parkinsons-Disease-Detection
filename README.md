# Parkinson's Disease Detection using SVM Classification

This project is a machine learning application that detects Parkinson's disease using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. The dataset used for training the model is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set).

## Overview

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection of Parkinson's disease can lead to better management and treatment. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can classify individuals as either having Parkinson's disease or being healthy based on certain features extracted from voice recordings.

## Files

- `Parkinson's_Disease_Detection.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using SVM classification.
- `parkinsons.csv`: Dataset downloaded from Kaggle, containing features extracted from voice recordings of individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various acoustic features extracted from the sustained phonation of vowels. For more details about the dataset, please refer to the Kaggle page.
